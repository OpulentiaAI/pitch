## Summary
- Replaced Midday pitch with "Agentic Foundations & Self‑Evolving Systems" deck to align with production‑ready agent narratives (plan→act→verify→learn, Temporal/Daytona grounding).
- Implemented Rachel‑Chen–inspired visual system (big type, tri‑columns, split comparisons, clean assertions) across new sections.
- Added S1–S12 slides (pillars, patterns, survey, Cursor online RL, rollout, Temporal, Daytona, optimizations, memory, evidence, end‑to‑end demo path).
- Included machine‑readable Verification Rubric slide and Appendix: Quick Commands.

## Nature of changes
- New slide components under `src/components/pitch/*`.
- Rewired `pitch-carousel.tsx` to the new deck; updated share UI to GitHub link.
- Non‑breaking for Next app; this branch replaces the deck content only.

## Impact
- Establishes durable, evidence‑gated agent narrative and structure.
- Provides concrete artifacts and guardrails messaging for investors/partners.
- Creates a base for adding screenshots/reference images and CTA/roadmap slides next.

## Why
- Move from product demo to a platform thesis focused on reliability, determinism, artifacts, and learning loops that evolve safely in production.

## Next steps (follow‑on PRs)
- Add reference screenshots (Rachel‑style exemplars) under `public/references/` with attribution.
- Implement "Announcement‑optimized" anchors (Opening Challenge, Vision, Architecture Immersion, CTA) and judge/LLM-as-a-judge micro-schemas.
- Optional: add Download PDF route and per‑slide meta.
